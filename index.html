      <h3 id="one" class="info">Intro to Algorithm</h3>
      <p>What are algorithms and why should you care? We'll start with an overview of algorithms and then discuss two games that you could use an algorithm to solve more efficiently - the number guessing game and a route-finding game. Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.<br><br> Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.<br><br>There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms.</p>

      <h3 id="two" class="info">Binary Search</h3>
      <p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. </p>

      <h3 id="three" class="info">Asympotic Notation</h3>
      <p>Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case, and worst case scenario of an algorithm.<br><br>Asymptotic analysis is input bound i.e., if there's no input to the algorithm, it is concluded to work in a constant time. Other than the "input" all other factors are considered constant.</p>

      <h3 id="four" class="info">Graph Representation</h3>
      <p>In graph theory, a graph representation is a technique to store graph into the memory of computer.<br>To represent a graph, we just need the set of vertices, and for each vertex the neighbors of the vertex (vertices which is directly connected to it by an edge). If it is a weighted graph, then the weight will be associated with each edge.</p>

      <h3 id="five" class="info">Selection Sort</h3>
      <p>Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.</p>

      <h3 id="six" class="info">Insertion Sort</h3>
      <p>This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, insertion sort.<br>The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.</p>

      <h3 id="seven" class="info">Recursive Algorithms</h3>
      <p>A recursive algorithm is an algorithm which calls itself with "smaller (or simpler)" input values, and which obtains the result for the current input by applying simple operations to the returned value for the smaller (or simpler) input. More generally if a problem can be solved utilizing solutions to smaller versions of the same problem, and the smaller versions reduce to easily solvable cases, then one can use a recursive algorithm to solve that problem. For example, the elements of a recursively defined set, or the value of a recursively defined function can be obtained by a recursive algorithm.</p>

      <h3 id="eight" class="info">Tower of Hanoi</h3>
      <p>The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.</p>

      <h3 id="nine" class="info">Merge Sort</h3>
      <p>Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.</p>
      <center><button class="button one">For More Info</button>

      <h3 id="ten" class="info">Quick Sort</h3>
      <p>Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.<br>Quicksort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are O(nLogn) and image.png(n2), respectively.</p>

Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code.As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, for, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an algorithm.We write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. <br><br>Algorithm writing is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined. That is, we should know the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution. <br><br> Time complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the algorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step consumes constant time. <br><br> For example, addition of two n-bit integers takes n steps. Consequently, the total computational time is T(n) = c âˆ— n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. Here, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases.";
